## 1. Define universal settlement?
Universal settlement refers to the irreversible finalisation of a transaction. Once a transaction is universally settled, it means that the transfer has been completed, this transaction cannot be reversed or modified because it was already executed. 

## 2. Why is Universal Settlement important and how is ZKM achieving this?
This concept is crucial because it provides assurance that a transaction cannot be reversed, enhancing trust and reliability.  ZKM is achieving this through the implementation of entangled rollups. By leveraging entangled rollups, this way ensures that transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain.

## 3. What is an Entangled Rollup? Describe its capabilities
This is a mechanism for securely and trustlessly transferring messages or data from one blockchain to another using zkp. Its primary capability lies in enabling interoperability between different blockchain networks. This is achieved by facilitating the seamless transfer of assets, messages, or funds across chains, even if they are built on incompatible protocols or have different consensus mechanisms.  

## 4. How Does the Analogy of Quantum Entanglement Relate to ZKM's Quantum Network?
I think it draws parallels to the unique connection shared by entangled particles in quantum mechanics. In quantum entanglement, when the state of one particle is measured, the state of its entangled counterpart instantaneously reflects the same state, irrespective of the distance between them. Similarly, in ZKM's Quantum Network, zkps enable that a statement is true without divulging any additional information about the statement itself. This analogy underscores the ZKM ability to maintain the properties of messages across different or incompatible blockchains.

## 5. Elaborate on the Advantages that ZKM's Quantum Network offers.
-Firstly, it provides interoperability by enabling communication between incompatible or isolated blockchains, regardless of their underlying architecture. 
-Secondly, the ZKM Quantum network operates in a trustless manner, meaning it doesn't rely on external third-party validators.  
-Additionally, ZKM enables native liquidity across incompatible chains. For example, funds deposited into an L1 within the quantum network can seamlessly be utilized across all L2s, and users can withdraw funds to any other L1. This native liquidity feature streamlines asset management and enhances user experience within the network.

My idea os Use Case:

`Submited use case for ZKM in Discord`✅


I think a good use case could be focused on interoperability and privacy. ZKM could facilitate the transfer of assets between incompatible or isolated chains, this would be cool because it would eliminate problems such as liquidity of DeFi protocols. Furthermore, to simplify adoption processes ZKM would improve the user experience in dapps. It would also include improving participation in multi-chain governance processes. It should be noted that the security and privacy of transactions are guaranteed through the use of zkp. All of this would provide global access to users, creating an inclusive web3 ecosystem that allows people from all over the world to participate in it safely and reliably. My use case offers an interesting solution that would drive mass adoption of blockchain while ensuring security, privacy, and interoperability across the board.
